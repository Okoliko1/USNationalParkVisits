The Sankey diagram visualizes the flow of visits to the U.S National Park from 1979 â€“ 2023, showing how visits to the National Parks are distributed across different states and regions, with the size of the nodes reflecting the distribution of visits. The Left sections represent individual states grouped by their respective regions, which are shown in the middle of the diagram which flows and aggregates into the total visits displayed at the right.
